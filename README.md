# apostrophe-snippets

`apostrophe-snippet` adds a repository of reusable content snippets to the [Apostrophe](http://github.com/punkave/apostrophe) content management system. Just as important, `apostrophe-snippet` provides a base on which the `apostrophe-blog` and `apostrophe-events` modules are built, among other modules that introduce new content types. One can add a page to the site that displays a collection of snippet titles in alphabetical order and click on these to access individual snippets on their own permalink pages. The blog and events modules extend this behavior to achieve similar goals with a minimum of code duplication.
